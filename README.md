This is a Vim plugin that opens `file.py` if you've asked it to edit `file`. If
`file` exists or `file.py` doesn't, it does not interfere. Supported extensions
are `.go`, `.py` and `.html`.

*Note*: plugin has been renamed into ext-completer. If you've used
pyext-completer before, please update your `.vimrc` to continue receiving
updates.

To install this plugin, first install
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and then add

    Plugin 'rryk/ext-completer'

to your `.vimrc`.
